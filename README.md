# Munder Difflin Paper

Goal of the Project:
To implement my new Front-End knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript into a website for a fictional paper company based on the show "The Office."

This was my first project as a student at NYCDA.

I really tried to make a simple and attractive UI for the user.

This site is a one-page scroll site. 

I most enjoyed creating a fluid color scheme including the changing of the scroll bar color:
